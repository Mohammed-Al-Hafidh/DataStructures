Day01TwoDimArrays
-----------------

Ask user for width and height of an array.
Values must be numerical, 1 or greater.
If not display an error message and end the program.

Allocate two-dimensional array of integers of given width and height.

Generate random values from -99 to 99 and assign to each cell of the array.

Display the array to the user in a user-friendly manner, where columns have all the same width (commas align). Example:

 -99,  2  ,  22
  15, -71,  5

Compute and display:
1) Sum of all numbers in the array
2) Sum of each of the row of the array
3) Sum of each of the column of the array
4) Standard deviation of all numbers in the array (google it !!!)
5) Find pairs of numbers in the array whose sum is a prime number and display those pairs and their sum.
(assume that negative number is not a prime number)
